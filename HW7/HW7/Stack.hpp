 Stack class implements StackInterface abstract class. This version is self growing
 when the array on to which items are pushed is filled. The self expanding array
 is implemented by using a pointer of ItemType, that points to a dynamically
 allocated and growing array. The memory allocation for this array is done inside
 the constructor of Stack Class.
 
 Since this class contains a pointer data member for whcih memory allocation is done
 inside the constructor, the rule of three kicks in. The rule of three requires that
 when a class has one or more pointer data members for which the memory allocation is
 done inside the constructor, then the class must provide the below to replace defaults:
 1. A destructor that will dellocate the memory that was allocated by the constructor.
 Understand that destructor are:
 A. Not overloadable
 B. Are NEVER called in programmer code by the programmer. They work behind the scene
 automatically.
 C. Are NOT ALLOWED to take arguments.
 D. Have same name as class name but with a ~ in front.
 
 2. I user defined copy constructor that meakes deep copies.
 3. A user defined Assignment operator that makes a deep copy when one object
 is copied into other using the assignment operator.
 
 Since class would have an array that would expand by itself when push is attempted
 after array is filled, major changes are required to push function that was there in the
 limited array class earlier used by you in assignments 4 and 5.
